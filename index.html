          Hello! My name is Denart Ifurung. My background is in biology, organic
          chemistry, and medicine. Since I was young, I have always gravitated
          towards areas of study that involve the diagnosis of a problem and
          finding its resolution. That is very likely why I find myself
          currently delving into the world of computer programming and web
          development. It is the combination of technical analysis and problem
          solving, combined with the opportunity to create something that
          uniquely your own that fascinates me. While this may be a new
          direction for me, with its own set of distinctive challenges, I look
          forward to taking this journey, wherever it leads.

        <p>
          Though I am interested in programming and web development as a whole,
          both my academic and personal health experiences have led to a
          particular focus in healthcare. In medicine, communication is of
          paramount importance. Whether it is between the patients, doctors,
          their staff, or even between medical devices and diagnostic tools,
          there needs to be a robust, efficient line of communication in order
          to ensure the patient's best interests. The internet and web
          communication are quickly becoming cornerstones for this. The
          challenges we faced the past few years only exacerbated this need and
          revealed the importance remote communication can have in healthcare.
          As such, I would love to work within the healthcare industry
          developing solutions that streamline these lines of communications. I
          believe that technology not only has the potential to make things more
          convenient for medical professionals, beyond that I am truly convinced
          that it can have a positive impact on patient morbidity and mortality,
          and improve clinical outcomes in general.
