        <p>
          Hello! My name is Denart Ifurung. I have a background in biology,
          organic chemistry, and medicine. Through the years I have always
          gravitated towards subjects that involve the diagnosis of a problem
          and finding its resolution. That is very likely why I find myself
          currently delving into the world of computer programming and web
          development. It is the combination of technical analysis and problem
          solving, combined with the opportunity to create something that
          uniquely your own that fascinates me. While this may be a new
          direction for me, with its own set of distinctive challenges, I look
          forward to taking this journey, wherever it takes me.

        <p>
          Though I am interested in programming and web development as a whole,
          both my personal and academic experiences have led to a particular
          interest in healthcare. In medicine, communication is of paramount
          importance. Whether it is between the patients, doctors, their staff,
          or even between medical devices and diagnostic tools, there needs to
          be a robust, efficient line of communication in order to ensure the
          patients best interests. The internet and web communication is quickly
          becoming a cornerstone of that. The last few years only exacerbated
          this need and revealed how important remote communication can be in
          healthcare. I would be greatly interested in working within the
          healthcare industry in order to develop solutions that streamline
          these lines of communications. I believe that technology not only has
          the potential to make things more convenient for medical
          professionals, beyond that I am truly convinced that it can have a
          positive impact on morbidity and mortality, and improve clinical
          outcomes in general.
